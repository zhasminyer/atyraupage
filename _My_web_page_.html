      <div class="div_history_text">
        The wooden fort at the mouth of the Yaik River was founded in 1645 as
        Nizhny Yaitzky gorodok (literally, Lower Yaik Fort) by the Russian
        trader Gury Nazarov, a native of Yaroslavl, who specialized in trade
        with Khiva and Bukhara. The fort was plundered by the Yaik Cossacks,
        leading the Guriev family to rebuild it in stone (1647–62). Tsar Alexis
        sent a garrison of Streltsy to protect the fort from Cossack incursions.
        Despite these efforts, the Cossack rebel Stepan Razin held the town in
        1667 and 1668. The fort gradually lost its strategic significance and
        was demolished in 1810. Between 1708 and 1992 the city was known as
        Guriev. The Kazakh name Atyrau means 'river delta'. Two parts of the
        world have the city. The side of Samarskaya (right side of the river)
        lies in Europe and the left bank of Bukharskaya is in Asia. It was
        established in 1615, by the employer Mikhail Guriev, who applied the
        decree to tzar Mikhail Fedorovich for a monopoly in the mouth of Ural to
        fish sturgeons.[1]

      <p class="main_p">Geography of Atyrau city</p>
      <div class="div_history_text">
        Atyrau (together with Aktau) is Kazakhstan's main harbour city on the
        Caspian Sea, Atyrau at the delta of the Ural River. Atyrau city is
        approximately 20 metres (66 feet) below sea level. The city is
        considered to be located both in Asia and Europe, as it is divided by
        the Ural River. The city is a hub for the oil-rich Caspian Depression;
        because of this, many oil wells have been drilled in the Tengiz Field
        and Kashagan Field areas. An oil pipeline runs from Atyrau to Samara,
        where it joins the Russian pipeline system. A separate oil pipeline runs
        from the Tengiz field to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.

      <p class="main_p">Climate of Atyrau city</p>
      <div class="div_history_text">
        Atyrau's climate is semi-arid (Köppen climate classification BSk), just
        shy of being classified as arid (Köppen climate classification BWk),
        with hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation is low throughout the
        year. Snow is common, though light in winter. The lowest temperature on
        record is −37.9 °C (−36.2 °F), recorded in 1909, and the highest
        temperature is 42.7 °C (108.9 °F), recorded in 1984.[2] It is much more
        continental than areas further west on the European continent, with
        summers characterized by temperatures averaging 33 °C (91 °F) and lack
        of precipitation, resembling continental hot-summer mediterranean
        climates, and subarctic winters with little snow but with chilling
        temperatures. These vast temperature swings are more comparable to
        Siberia and the North American plains.
